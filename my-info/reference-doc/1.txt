Our ios and android will send text to our custom java api and then the java api will respond pcm streams to our app, so i think we can capture these pcm streams used for tts playback by speakers, and our android app is using API level >=27. in this case, tell me a cross platform solution using cpp with webRTC AEC to remove echo of tts
We are in a scenario where:
1. The app (iOS and Android) sends text to a custom Java API and receives PCM streams for TTS playback.
2. We have control over the PCM buffers since we receive them from the network (or generate locally? The problem says the Java API responds with PCM streams, so we receive them in the app).
3. We want to use WebRTC's AEC (from the Audio Processing Module - APM) to remove the echo of the TTS playback from the microphone input.
Given that we have the PCM buffers for TTS before playback, we can feed them to the WebRTC APM as the reference (far-end) signal.
Cross-platform solution in C++:
- We can write a shared C++ layer that uses WebRTC's APM for both Android and iOS.
- The app will pass the received TTS PCM buffers to this C++ layer (as the reference signal) and also pass the recorded microphone buffers (to be processed for echo cancellation).
Steps:
1. **Initialize the WebRTC APM**:
   - We need to set up the APM with the appropriate sample rate, number of channels, and enable AEC.
2. **Feed the TTS (reference) audio**:
   - For each chunk of TTS audio that we are about to play, we pass it to the APM as the reverse stream (reference) using `ProcessReverseStream()`.
3. **Process the microphone audio**:
   - For each chunk of microphone audio, we pass it to `ProcessStream()` to get the echo-cancelled audio.
4. **Handle platform-specific audio playback and recording**:
   - On Android, we can use `AudioTrack` for playback and `AudioRecord` for recording.
   - On iOS, we use `AVAudioEngine` or similar.
But note: The WebRTC APM requires that the reference signal (TTS) is fed in advance of the microphone capturing the echo. The delay between the reference signal and the echo in the microphone must be within the APM's ability to handle (usually up to 500 ms). We have to manage the timing.
Implementation:
We'll create a C++ class that wraps the WebRTC APM. The class will have:
- Methods to initialize the APM (with sample rate, number of channels, etc.)
- A method to feed the TTS audio (reference) before playback.
- A method to process the microphone audio.
We assume that the audio format is consistent (e.g., 16-bit PCM, 16 kHz sample rate, mono).
C++ Wrapper Example:
```cpp
#include <modules/audio_processing/include/audio_processing.h>
#include <system_wrappers/include/clock.h>
class EchoCanceller {
public:
    EchoCanceller(int sample_rate, int num_channels) {
        webrtc::AudioProcessingBuilder ap_builder;
        apm_ = ap_builder.Create();
        webrtc::AudioProcessing::Config config;
        config.echo_canceller.enabled = true;
        config.echo_canceller.mobile_mode = true; // Recommended for mobile
        apm_->ApplyConfig(config);
        // Configure processing settings
        webrtc::StreamConfig stream_config(sample_rate, num_channels);
        webrtc::StreamConfig reverse_config(sample_rate, num_channels);
        apm_->Initialize(stream_config, reverse_config);
    }
    // Feed TTS audio (reference) to APM. This should be called before playing the chunk.
    void ProcessReverseStream(const int16_t* data, size_t samples_per_channel) {
        // Use the same sample rate and channels as initialized
        webrtc::StreamConfig reverse_config(apm_->proc_sample_rate_hz(), apm_->num_reverse_channels());
        apm_->ProcessReverseStream(data, reverse_config, reverse_config, data);
    }
    // Process microphone audio (removes echo). Returns processed audio in the same buffer.
    void ProcessStream(int16_t* data, size_t samples_per_channel) {
        webrtc::StreamConfig stream_config(apm_->proc_sample_rate_hz(), apm_->num_input_channels());
        apm_->ProcessStream(data, stream_config, stream_config, data);
    }
private:
    rtc::scoped_refptr<webrtc::AudioProcessing> apm_;
};
```
Note: WebRTC APM requires that the sample rates for both the reverse and forward streams are the same. Also, the number of channels for the reverse stream can be different (but typically we use mono). In the above, we assume the same sample rate and same number of channels for simplicity.
Platform Integration:
Android (using JNI to call into C++):
- When you receive the TTS PCM, before playing it with `AudioTrack`, pass it to the C++ `EchoCanceller::ProcessReverseStream`.
- For the microphone, set up an `AudioRecord` and pass each chunk to `EchoCanceller::ProcessStream` and then use the processed audio.
iOS (using Objective-C++ to call C++):
- Similarly, when you get TTS PCM, before playing with `AVAudioPlayer` or `AVAudioEngine`, pass the buffer to the C++ layer for `ProcessReverseStream`.
- For the microphone, use an `AVAudioEngine` input node and in the tap block, pass the buffer to `ProcessStream`.
Important Considerations:
1. **Timing**: The reference signal (TTS) must be fed to the APM before the corresponding echo is captured by the microphone. This requires that the TTS audio is fed to the APM a little before (or at least at the same time) as it is played. The APM can handle some delay (up to 500 ms) but it's better to be as close as possible.
2. **Audio Session Management**: On both platforms, we must manage the audio session to avoid conflicts and set the correct audio route (e.g., when using speaker vs headset).
3. **Delay Handling**: The APM may need to know the total delay from when the reference signal is fed to when it is played and then captured by the microphone. This is device-specific and can be hard to estimate. However, WebRTC APM has an automatic delay estimator that usually works well.
4. **Buffer Sizes**: Use consistent buffer sizes (e.g., 10 ms chunks). For 16 kHz, that's 160 samples per chunk.
5. **Thread Safety**: The APM is not thread-safe. Ensure that both `ProcessReverseStream` and `ProcessStream` are called from the same thread or properly synchronized.
6. **Sample Rate and Channel Matching**: The APM must be initialized with the same sample rate and channel configuration as the audio you are processing. Also, the reverse and forward streams must have the same sample rate.
7. **Error Handling**: Check the return values of the APM functions.
8. **WebRTC Library**: You'll need to build the WebRTC APM for Android and iOS. You can use the precompiled libraries from WebRTC or build it yourself.
Steps to integrate WebRTC:
- For Android, you can use the official WebRTC Android SDK (Maven) and write JNI code to access the APM.
- For iOS, you can use the CocoaPod for WebRTC.
But note: The WebRTC APM is part of the WebRTC native code. You might need to build the native library for both platforms.
Alternative: Use the built-in AEC on Android (if available) and a custom solution for iOS. However, the question specifically asks for a cross-platform solution with WebRTC.
Given the complexity, I recommend:
- Creating a shared C++ library that uses WebRTC APM.
- For Android, use the JNI to call into this library.
- For iOS, use Objective-C++ to call into the same library.
This approach will maximize code reuse and ensure consistent AEC behavior on both platforms.
Let me know if you need more details on any specific part.
Based on your scenario where both iOS and Android apps receive PCM streams from your Java API for TTS playback, you can implement a cross-platform C++ solution using WebRTC's AEC module. Here's how:

Code







Step-by-Step Implementation
1. Prerequisites
WebRTC C++ Library: Compile WebRTC for iOS and Android.

Audio Buffer Access: You already have TTS PCM buffers from your Java API.

Audio Pipeline: Control over both playback (TTS) and microphone capture.

2. Core C++ AEC Module (Shared Code)
Create a header aec_processor.h:

cpp
#include <modules/audio_processing/include/audio_processing.h>

class AECProcessor {
public:
    AECProcessor(int sample_rate, int channels);
    ~AECProcessor();
    
    // Call with TTS audio BEFORE playback
    void ProcessReverseStream(const int16_t* audio_data, size_t samples_per_channel);
    
    // Call with mic audio (echo removed in-place)
    void ProcessCaptureStream(int16_t* audio_data, size_t samples_per_channel);
    
    // Adjust for hardware delays (call once during init)
    void SetStreamDelay(int delay_ms);

private:
    webrtc::AudioProcessing* apm_;
    bool initialized_;
};
Implement aec_processor.cpp:

cpp
AECProcessor::AECProcessor(int sample_rate, int channels) {
    webrtc::AudioProcessingBuilder builder;
    apm_ = builder.Create();
    
    webrtc::AudioProcessing::Config config;
    config.echo_canceller.enabled = true;
    config.echo_canceller.mobile_mode = true;  // Optimized for mobile
    apm_->ApplyConfig(config);
    
    // Initialize processing formats
    webrtc::StreamConfig play_config(sample_rate, channels);
    webrtc::StreamConfig rec_config(sample_rate, channels);
    apm_->Initialize(rec_config, play_config);
}

void AECProcessor::ProcessReverseStream(const int16_t* audio_data, 
                                       size_t samples_per_channel) {
    webrtc::StreamConfig config(apm_->proc_sample_rate_hz(), 
                               apm_->num_reverse_channels());
    apm_->ProcessReverseStream(audio_data, config, config, audio_data);
}

void AECProcessor::ProcessCaptureStream(int16_t* audio_data, 
                                       size_t samples_per_channel) {
    webrtc::StreamConfig config(apm_->proc_sample_rate_hz(),
                               apm_->num_input_channels());
    apm_->ProcessStream(audio_data, config, config, audio_data);
}

void AECProcessor::SetStreamDelay(int delay_ms) {
    apm_->set_stream_delay_ms(delay_ms);
}
3. Platform-Specific Integration
Android (Java/JNI):

java
public class AudioProcessor {
    private long nativePtr; // Pointer to C++ AECProcessor
    
    // Load native library
    static { System.loadLibrary("aecmodule"); }
    
    // Native methods
    private native long nativeInitAEC(int sampleRate, int channels);
    private native void nativeProcessReverse(long ptr, byte[] pcmData);
    private native void nativeProcessCapture(long ptr, byte[] micData);
    
    public AudioProcessor() {
        nativePtr = nativeInitAEC(16000, 1); // 16kHz mono
    }
    
    public void processTTSBeforePlayback(byte[] ttsPcm) {
        nativeProcessReverse(nativePtr, ttsPcm);
    }
    
    public byte[] processMicAudio(byte[] micPcm) {
        nativeProcessCapture(nativePtr, micPcm);
        return micPcm; // Echo removed in-place
    }
}
JNI Implementation (jni_interface.cpp):

cpp
extern "C" JNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL
Java_com_yourpackage_AudioProcessor_nativeInitAEC(
    JNIEnv* env, jobject obj, jint sample_rate, jint channels) {
    auto processor = new AECProcessor(sample_rate, channels);
    return reinterpret_cast<jlong>(processor);
}

extern "C" JNIEXPORT void JNICALL
Java_com_yourpackage_AudioProcessor_nativeProcessReverse(
    JNIEnv* env, jobject obj, jlong ptr, jbyteArray pcm_data) {
    auto processor = reinterpret_cast<AECProcessor*>(ptr);
    jshort* audio = env->GetShortArrayElements(pcm_data, nullptr);
    jsize length = env->GetArrayLength(pcm_data);
    processor->ProcessReverseStream(audio, length / sizeof(int16_t));
    env->ReleaseShortArrayElements(pcm_data, audio, 0);
}
iOS (Objective-C++):

objectivec
// AudioProcessor.h
@interface AudioProcessor : NSObject
- (instancetype)initWithSampleRate:(int)sampleRate channels:(int)channels;
- (void)processTTSBeforePlayback:(NSData*)pcmData;
- (NSData*)processMicAudio:(NSData*)micData;
@end

// AudioProcessor.mm
#import "aec_processor.h"

@implementation AudioProcessor {
    std::unique_ptr<AECProcessor> _aec;
}

- (instancetype)initWithSampleRate:(int)sampleRate channels:(int)channels {
    _aec = std::make_unique<AECProcessor>(sampleRate, channels);
    [_aec SetStreamDelay:50]; // Device-specific delay
    return self;
}

- (void)processTTSBeforePlayback:(NSData*)pcmData {
    const int16_t* audio = static_cast<const int16_t*>(pcmData.bytes);
    size_t samples = pcmData.length / sizeof(int16_t);
    _aec->ProcessReverseStream(audio, samples);
}

- (NSData*)processMicAudio:(NSData*)micData {
    NSMutableData* mutableData = [micData mutableCopy];
    int16_t* audio = static_cast<int16_t*>(mutableData.mutableBytes);
    size_t samples = micData.length / sizeof(int16_t);
    _aec->ProcessCaptureStream(audio, samples);
    return mutableData;
}
@end

Code
5. Critical Optimizations
Buffer Timing:

Feed TTS buffers to AEC 5-20ms before playback

Use 10ms chunks (e.g., 160 samples at 16kHz)

Hardware Delay Calibration:

cpp
// Android: Get output buffer size
int bufferSize = audioTrack.getBufferSizeInFrames();
int delayMs = (bufferSize * 1000) / sampleRate;

// iOS: Use AVAudioSession preferred IO buffer duration
double bufferDuration = [AVAudioSession sharedInstance].preferredIOBufferDuration;
int delayMs = bufferDuration * 1000;
Bluetooth Handling:

Disable AEC when audio routed externally:

java
// Android
if (audioManager.isBluetoothA2dpOn()) {
    aecProcessor.disable();
}
objc
// iOS
if ([[AVAudioSession sharedInstance] currentRoute].outputs contains Bluetooth) {
    [aecProcessor disable];
}
Sample Rate Matching:

Resample all audio to 16kHz mono (WebRTC's optimal format)

Why This Works
Direct Buffer Access: You control TTS PCM before playback

Timely Processing: TTS audio fed to AEC before echo occurs

Cross-Platform: Shared C++ core reduces maintenance

WebRTC Optimizations: mobile_mode=true handles mobile-specific echo paths

Limitations to Test
Extreme Latencies: Phones with >100ms audio hardware delays

Speaker Volume: AEC effectiveness degrades at >85% volume

Background Noise: WebRTC AEC works best with SNR >15dB

For production, add noise suppression and gain control in the same WebRTC APM instance by extending the config:

cpp
config.noise_suppression.enabled = true;
config.gain_controller1.enabled = true;
